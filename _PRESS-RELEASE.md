There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  <!-- > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. -->
  Jobascript

## Sub-Heading ##
  <!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
  This all-in-one solution is catered towards recent grads entering the job market providing job tracking capabilites, and other features.

## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  You're in the flow of applying to jobs one after another. You lose track of them, and forget which ones you've applied to, how long it's been since you've applied.
  Jobascript takes care of that. You enter the job you've applied to, and this product will keep track of how much time has passed and will notify you to send a follow-up email if it hasn't been updated
  within an `x` number of days. You can also use this product to search for jobs as well.

## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
  This product will take care of job seekers who lose track of the applications they've sent and how many. It also will provide a history of applications so that you can reflect on where you've come from.

## Solution ##
  <!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
  When you enter the job information into this product, it will persist store that information into a database. It will keep track of the date you wrote it in, so that after an `x` number of days, it will notify
  you to send a follow-up email. It will also employ a `Job Search API` so that you can continue to look for jobs.

## Quote from You ##
  <!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
  Jobascript will be your next step in getting your next job!

## How to Get Started ##
  <!-- > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
  Simply enter the job you've applied and let Jobascript take care of the rest.

## Customer Quote ##
  <!-- > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
  "Wow! Jobascript really helped me stay on top of the jobs I've applied to and has been super helpful in reminding me to send follow-ups. Out of the 76 jobs I've applied to, I was reminded to send follow-ups for each one, and heard back from 45 of them!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##

  Your next step is to go to LinkedIn, Indeed, Angelist, or whatever your preference is and simply start logging your applications away.
